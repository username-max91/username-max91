- 👋 Hi, I’m @username-max91 or Max to keep it short. Welcome to my github page!
- 👀 I’m interested in Web technologies, development of meaningful and functional applications, sustainability, humanity, life.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and will never stop. My current agenda covers front-end technologies, as I would like to switch my career asap to have my job in the same field as my interests.
- 💞️ As I’m at the start of my Web development journey, I'm eager to find an experienced buddy / sensei.
- 📫 If you'd like to get in touch for any reason, feel free to drop me an email: supernova.in@protonmail.com
